# Join us at our "startup for grown-ups"

Working Group Two is here to change the telecom industry, and to do so we need more great people. Our ambition is to make your mobile subscription much more useful and relevant than it is today. For that to happen we need to change the way traditional telecom works by making telecom work the “internet way”. This includes making operators work on a platform, controlling our own technology, enabling rapid iterations and focus on the end-user experience.

We are building a core network as-a-service and as-a-platform. Our platform works across multiple underlying telecom networks, and we thereby make it easier to create product innovations across operators. Furthermore, we are working to expose core network functionality through APIs, and create an eco-system for developers.

We have offices in Stockholm and Oslo, with a hub in Trondheim. We offer competitive base compensation packages, and the opportunity to take part in the upside of the company. We are a mix between a start-up and a traditional company, we sometimes call it “start-up for grown-ups”. 

We are a bunch of great people with different skillset that have come together to change a traditional industry. We find inspiration from each other and believe that with bright people, commitment and a willingness to invest for long-term you can achieve great things.

**We are hiring** in the following areas:

*   **Ops and infrastructure** specialists to help us build a secure, flexible and scalable telecom grade infrastructure the Internet way (experience with AWS and Docker is helpful)
*   **Mobile core network** experts that can help us bring the telecom world into the Internet world
*   **Developers and product managers** with experience of building **APIs/SDKs** as products for developers
*   **Backend and front-end developers** with experience and passion for real time communication services, security, and scalable services

Having telecom domain knowledge is not a requirement.

**If you are interested in any of these postions or if you think you are a good fit for another role, let us get to know you, please send us a short discription about yourself to career@wgtwo.com.**
