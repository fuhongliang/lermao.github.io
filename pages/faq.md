# Frequently asked questions

### What other partnerships do I need to put in place to work with you? 

The most important partnership you put in place is the access to radio network wholesale capacity. In addition you will need national and international interconnect agreements, roaming agreements, a BSS partner, a SIM vendor, potentially a number portability partner and a few more. We can help you with many of these, and we have pre-existing integrations with some. 

### Can I scrap my existing core network? 

We are building a core network for the future, among other things that means that we don't bring every single legacy feature with us. In other words, if you are an existing MNO with legacy infrastructure you can probably not scrap your existing core network, but set up our core network in parallel with your existing one, and migrate over time. 

### What "Gs" do you support?

We support 2G, 3G and 4G. In 4G we are currently developing VoLTE/VoWiFi. We also support VoIP through webRTC protocols as an integrated part of the platform. We also offer some aspects of 5G through being able to run separate tenancies of the core network. We will continuously build and improve our network. Our approach is more about solving use-cases supported by the radio network as opposed to "jumping Gs". 

### What functionality does your network support? 

We deliver user databases, voice, messaging and internet connectivity from the core network. In telco terms we have the HLR/HSS, SMSC, MMSC, MSC and PGW. 

### What is the business model? 

We charge an affordable start-up and integration fee. We then charge a fee per active user, as well as a revenue share on services that are monetized on top of the platform.


### Can you really run telco out of the public cloud? 

We know it is highly untraditional to run telco out of public cloud. However, we believe the "internet scale" services of the world are building infrastructure with tools and philosophies that over time will become more reliable and flexible than what an individual operator will be able to do. We are using these tools to enable us to be more flexible, effective and efficient than what would otherwise have been possible. 

### What about data transfer, GDPR and national data laws? 

We comply with GDPR regulations. Depending on where customers are located, what data centers are available and the status of national regulations we believe we can comply with the demands of most potential customers. In countries where security law demands that data is not transferred across borders, we depend on our partners having operational data centers within the boarders of that country. 

### How long does it take to get started? 

This really depends. Theoretically, in a country already set up and with partners integrated, minutes. More realistically and practically, a few months. The timeline will be driven by your own readiness, the number of new integrations and the complexity of integrations. As a rule of thumb, we would estimate 3-6 months. 

### Does this cross-network thing really work? 

We run a uniform code based deployed from public cloud. So yes, it works. When we publish APIs we will ensure they are based on a consistent infrastucture and code base, allowing developers to make things once, and only once. 

### You talk about a product eco-system, what do you mean? 

We want to replicate the dynamics of app stores from the smartphone world in the world of mobile networks. Our ambition is to abstract the complexity of the underlying hardware (radio networks) by creating a uniform software layer (the core network) that works across many networks, open up the network level functionality and together with partners create a rich suite of products and services for consumers and businesses. We plan to create monetization mechanisms and systems for how end-users can activate services. We are on our way to building great APIs with great documentation and support.
