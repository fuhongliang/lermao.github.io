# What are we about?

Mobile communication has been immensely successful. With over five billion users it is one of the world's most widely used technologies. 

This reach has a price. Extreme standardization, local implementations and configurations,  as well as decades of accumulated legacy have effectively stifled product and service innovation. Operators have largely been left with innovating on pricing, billing and bundling while  leaving new products and services to come from internet players.

Our ambition is to bridge these two worlds: Enable operators to utilize their local presence, customers and reach with modern technology to give mobile operators the innovation capacity of an internet player. 

We do this in four steps: 
1. We rebuild telco the "internet way"
2. We make our software work across radio networks
3. We open up network functionality previously hidden from view 
4. We create the basis for an product eco-system

As a partner or developer you should build or integrate a product once, and it will work for multiple operators in multiple geographies.

Our success is measured by that end-users find their mobile subscription much more useful.
